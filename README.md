# Quora

Problem Statement
Project Brief
In this project, you will work on developing REST API endpoints of various functionalities required for a website (similar to Quora) from scratch. In order to observe the functionality of the endpoints, you will use the Swagger user interface and store the data in the PostgreSQL database. Also, the project has to be implemented using Java Persistence API (JPA).

 

This is a group project, you would be working in a group of 3 or 4 students and there would be one final submission. Use Git and GitHub to conduct version control of your assignment code throughout your assignment development.

As you have learnt in the version control module, it is a good software engineering practice to use version control while developing software.

In your submission, include a link to your GitHub repo that contains the course 5 project code.

Download the stub file provided below and work on the same file to implement the required API endpoints as per the given problem statement.

Github Collaboration Instructions
One of the team members should act as the project lead, create a master repository for the project, and push the initial code stub to the master repository. After which, the project lead would create different branches for different functionalities to be developed, and share the repository URL with other team members.

 

The other team members should then fork and clone the master repository to their own repository on GitHub, so they can work on a specific branch and make updates on the project via pull requests. Also, it would be the project leader's responsibility to merge the pull requests into the master repository. It is always a good practice for each member of the team to review a pull request before it is merged into the master repository and give your comments on the pull request to help the project leader.

 

Lastly, if you are working off a fork, don't forget to fetch from the upstream repository often, so you can get the latest commits and updates of the various branches in the upstream repository. Also, once all the required code implementation is done on a specific branch and is working fine, then the project lead can go ahead and merge the branch with the master repository.

 

A few additional notes to help your collaboration between teammates:

Use Github to track issues and bugs for the project.
Use Github to conduct code reviews, so each push request or commits are reviewed by another teammate before the code changes are merged into the main repository.
 

Database Schema
The database schema required for the project is designed and provided, as shown in the following image.



You need to manually create a database named "quora" in your PostgreSQL and run the SQL queries against the database provided in the stub file by activating the profile setup.
You need to update the environment variables such as server port, database name, database password in localhost.properties file in the folder located in quora-db/src/main/resources/config to integrate the database into your system with the project. 
Let us recall the concept of the foreign key when a column in a table references the primary key of some other table for its reference. The table containing the primary key is a parent table and the child table contains a foreign key. When a table is related by some other table in the database and you try to delete a record from the parent table, what will happen? PostgreSQL gives the following option:
DELETE CASCADE - In this case, all the referenced records in the child table will be deleted first and then the parent record will be deleted.

 

In the Quora project, we have used DELETE CASCADE option to delete all the referenced records in the child table first and then the record in the parent table. You can use @OnDelete(action = OnDeleteAction.CASCADE) annotation in JPA to specify the foreign key attribute in the Java class for DELETE CASCADE option.

 

Project Structure
The project must follow a definite structure in order to help the co-developers and reviewers for easy understanding. Also, the better project structure makes your code modular and it becomes easier to implement any new features on the existing application. Follow the directory structure given in the project stub file. The main module is divided into three sub-modules â€”  quora-api, quora-db, and quora-service.

 

1. quora-api

config - This directory must consist of all the required configuration files of the project (if any). We have already provided swagger config file in the stub.
controller - This directory must consist of all the controller classes required for the project (the list of required controllers along with the API endpoints are listed in the next segment).

exception - This directory must consist of the exception handlers for all the exceptions. You have to implement the code for exception handler for all the exceptions to be implemented in the project.

endpoints - This directory consists of the JSON files which are used to generate the Request and Response models.

test - This directory consists of tests for all the controller classes. You need to uncomment all the given test cases to run these test cases after implementing the project.

 

2. quora-db

config - This directory consists of the database properties and environment properties for local development.
sql - This directory consists of all the SQL queries to create database schema tables.
 

3. quora-service

business - This directory must consist of all the implementations of the business logic of the application.
dao - This directory allows us to isolate the application/business layer from the persistence layer and must consist of the implementation of all the data access object classes.
entity - This directory must consist of all the entity classes related to the project to map these class objects with the database. You need to observe the database schema and all the constraints given in SQL files carefully to map Java objects with the database.
exception - This directory consists of all the exceptions related to the project. All the exceptions required for the project have been implemented in the stub file.
 

Authentication and Authorization
The authentication functionality should be implemented in such a way that the API endpoints are accessible only when a user successfully logs in to the endpoint '/user/signin'. In such a case, the user should be able to subsequently access the endpoints by providing only the access token to each endpoint. Also, the user will have access to the endpoints defined in the 'AdminController' class based on the role information provided in the database, as defined below:

If the role of a user is 'admin', the user will be able to access all the API endpoints in the web application.

If the role of a user is 'nonadmin', the user cannot access the API endpoints defined in the AdminController class; he/she can, however, access the rest of the API endpoints defined in the other controller classes.
